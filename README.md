# Welcome to my Personal Portfolio Project!

This project is built using React.js and Tailwind CSS to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences. Additionally, I have implemented a theme changer using the Context API to provide a seamless dark/light mode experience. To add a touch of interactivity, I've incorporated the AOS (Animate On Scroll) library for smooth animations on scroll.
